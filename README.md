Front End Development Project for Code Louisville

This is my Project for the Front End Devleopment Course for Code Louisville at Bellarmine University. 

This project is a landing page for my forthcoming consulting group. I am currently an attorney practicing in Louisville, Kentucky. I hope to incorporate software development into my current practice. 

This landing page uses html, css, and javascript via Jquery. This landing page also utilizs a front-end framework, Bootstrap v. 4. 

The layout is simple and responsive. I attempted to employ a mimimalist design along with attractive photos. There is a fade 
in effect while scrolling down the page. This effect is only on the landing page because it looked best on landing page. The effect seemed wasted on the "Meet Brandon" page. 

I hope to add to this project as I learn more about developement and design.
